## 1️⃣ Core Decision: Multiple Agents vs Single Agent with Functions

Option 1: Single Agent with Multiple Tools/Functions (Recommended)  
- You can have one LangChain agent that can call different tools/functions depending on user intent.  
- Tools could include:  
  1. Create JSON geometry  
  2. Update JSON geometry  
  3. Query JSON from Supabase  
  4. General aviation knowledge Q&A  
- Pros: Easier to manage, a single conversation memory, more seamless multi-turn chats.  
- Cons: Slightly more logic inside the agent to detect which tool to call.

Option 2: Multiple Agents  
- One agent for JSON creation/updating, another for general aviation questions.  
- Pros: Separation of concerns; simpler prompts per agent.  
- Cons: Harder to maintain conversation memory across agents. Users switching between intents might feel inconsistent.

💡 Recommendation: Use one agent + multiple tools/functions. Let the agent route tasks dynamically.

## 2️⃣ Architecture Overview

Components:  

1. LangChain Agent – central brain.  
2. Memory – `ConversationBufferMemory` (do not use `ConversationSummaryMemory`) to remember previous messages.  
3. Tools/Functions:  
   - `create_geometry(data: dict)` → returns JSON  (Define each geometry as a Pydantic class with validation)
   - `update_geometry(id: str, key: str, value: any)` → modifies JSON in Supabase  
   - `query_aviation_knowledge(question: str)` → optional: use OpenAI or a vector store  
4. Supabase – store JSON geometries and possibly conversation logs.  
5. JSON Schema Validation – ensure created/updated JSON is valid for your aviation geometries.

## 3️⃣ Flow Example

1. User: “Create a TLOF for Flight ABC with length 30m and width 30m.”  
2. Agent detects intent → calls `create_geometry` → saves to Supabase → returns JSON.  
3. User: “Update TLOF width to 35m.”  
4. Agent detects update intent → calls `update_geometry` → modifies only width in Supabase.  
5. User: “What is the standard width for a helipad?”  
6. Agent detects Q&A intent → fetches answer from knowledge base or LLM → responds.

## 4️⃣ Python + LangChain Setup

- Agent: `initialize_agent` with `tools=[create, update, query]`  
- Memory: `ConversationBufferMemory`  
- Supabase: Python client `supabase-py`  
- JSON handling: Pydantic models or plain dicts with validation
