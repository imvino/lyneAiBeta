Subject: Engineering Brief No. 105 A, Vertiport Design 9 
10 
This Engineering Brief (EB) provides interim guidance for the design of vertiports for aircraft 11 
with vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities. Note that this interim guidance will be 12 
subject to update as data, analysis, and VTOL aircraft and operations develop in the future. 13 
This is a revision to the original Engineering Brief 105 issued on September 21, 2022. Principal 14 
changes include adjustments to the sizing of the fundamental vertiport geometry, grouping by 15 
powered versus non-powered-lift, the addition of a section on parking, and the creation of a 16 
downwash and outwash protection area: 17","{""page"":0,""title"":""Draft EB 105A, Vertiport Design, mmm xx, 2024"",""author"":""FAA Airport Engineering Division (AAS-100), 202-267-7669"",""source"":""_regulations\\FAA_USA\\FAA draft-eb-105a-vertiport_Sept.2024.pdf"",""company"":""Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)"",""creator"":""Acrobat PDFMaker 24 for Word"",""moddate"":""2024-09-20T09:58:22-04:00"",""subject"":""This Engineering Brief provides interim guidance for the design of vertiports for aircraft with vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities.

1. Geometry: Laid the foundation for performance-based landing geometry, creating a18 
subset of the controlling dimension (D) related to just the propulsion devices. Where19 
D is the diameter of the smallest circle enclosing of the entire VTOL aircraft20 
projections, D-p is the smallest circle enclosing just the propulsion units, which for21 
some eVTOL designs may be smaller than D. The geometry of the touchdown and22 
liftoff area (TLOF) and final approach and takeoff area (FATO) are now related to the23 
D-p rather than D. The safety area for both powered lift and non-powered lift has24 
decreased in size. See paragraph 2.0.25 
2. Powered/Non-powered-lift: Grouped aircraft by powered-lift and non-powered-lift26 
attributes.

3. Parking: Created a new section on eVTOL parking with bigger parking positions that 28 
allow air or hover taxiing to them rather than just ground taxiing. See paragraph 3.1. 29 
4. Downwash and Outwash Caution Area: Added a downwash/outwash caution area 30 
(DCA). Refer to the forthcoming FAA technical center research report on velocity 31 
findings for example distances for aircraft 7,000 lbs and less. See paragraph 2.5. 32

ENGINEERING BRIEF #105A 35 
Vertiport Design 36 
I Purpose. 37 
This Engineering Brief (EB) specifies design guidance for public and private vertiports1, 38 
including modification of existing helicopter and airplane landing facilities, and 39 
establishment of new sites. This EB is written for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) 40 
aircraft including those powered with electric motors and utilizing distributed electric 41 
propulsion in contrast to propulsion systems built solely around an internal combustion 42 
engine.  43 
At this time, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is still collecting validated 44 
VTOL aircraft operational data and is transitioning from a prescriptive approach to a 45 
performance-based design approach with the recommendations in this EB. This EB is 46 
written for aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 12,500 lbs (5,670 kg) or 47 
less.  48","{""page"":2,""title"":""Draft EB 105A, Vertiport Design, mmm xx, 2024"",""author"":""FAA Airport Engineering Division (AAS-100), 202-267-7669"",""source"":""_regulations\\FAA_USA\\FAA draft-eb-105a-vertiport_Sept.2024.pdf"",""company"":""Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)"",""creator"":""Acrobat PDFMaker 24 for Word"",""moddate"":""2024-09-20T09:58:22-04:00"",""subject"":""This Engineering Brief provides interim guidance for the design of vertiports for aircraft with vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities.

This EB is a living document that serves as the FAA’s interim guidance. An Advisory 49 
Circular (AC) will be developed to adapt and address new aircraft and technology as 50 
performance data is received. As minimum regulatory performance requirements are 51 
codified, they will supplant performance data that is received by way of operational 52 
testing, in developing vertiport design standards. This EB will be cancelled concurrent 53 
with the publication of the AC. 54 
Figures in this document are general representations and are not to scale. 55 
II Background. 56 
The FAA has identified a need for guidance for vertiports to be utilized by VTOL 57 
aircraft.  58 
The FAA’s previous AC on Vertiport Design, published on May 31, 1991, provided 59 
guidance for vertiport design and was based on civil tiltrotors modeled after military 60
