### 🧾 Root Cause of the \$81.60 Cost:

#### 1. **Service Involved**

* You were billed under **Cognitive Services > Azure OpenAI**.
* Specifically, this is related to a **fine-tuned GPT-4.1 model** hosted on Azure:

  * `gpt-4.1-ft hosting global Unit` indicates a **fine-tuned model hosting cost**.

#### 2. **Quantity**

* You were charged for **48.00096 units** of this hosting service.

#### 3. **Cost Breakdown**

* Unit cost:
  \$81.59904 ÷ 48.00096 ≈ **\$1.70 per unit**

* Azure charges hosting fees for fine-tuned models **per hour**.

  * **48 hours (\~2 days)** of hosting likely occurred.
  * This is **separate from prompt completion/token usage charges** — it’s a fixed **model hosting cost**.

#### 4. **Why You Were Charged**

* You deployed a **fine-tuned GPT-4.1 model** on Azure OpenAI.
* That model was **hosted for \~48 hours**, incurring a **fixed hourly hosting fee**.
* Even if you did not use the model actively (i.e., no completions), the hosting fee applies as long as the model is deployed.

---

### ✅ What You Can Do Next

#### Option 1: **Stop the Charges**

* **Delete or pause** the deployed fine-tuned model if you're not actively using it.

  * Go to the Azure Portal → Azure OpenAI → Deployments → Delete the fine-tuned model.

#### Option 2: **Audit Who/What Triggered the Model**

* Check **Azure Cost Analysis** or **Activity Logs** to see:

  * When the model was deployed
  * Who deployed it (if multiple team members have access)
  * How long it has been running

#### Option 3: **Use Consumption Instead of Hosting**

* If you don’t need a **fine-tuned** version, consider using the base GPT-4 model (no hosting fee, pay-per-use).
* Or, export the fine-tuned model and only deploy it when needed.

### 📌 Tip

Model hosting costs can be expensive — even idle models accrue charges. Azure does **not automatically pause or delete** idle deployments.

Would you like help locating this model in the Azure portal or writing an alert script to avoid future surprise bills?



That’s a solid summary — and it looks like you’re clear on what’s happening.

Since the charge was from **hosting a fine-tuned GPT-4.1 model**, and **48+ hours** of deployment time resulted in **\$81.60**, here are a few specific **next-step actions** you might want to take to fully close the loop:

## ✅ Immediate Actions to Take in Azure

### 🔍 1. **Find the Exact Resource**

Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and follow these steps:

* **Navigate to:**
  `Azure OpenAI` > `Deployments`
* **Filter by:**

  * Region: `US East`
  * Model: `gpt-4.1` or anything labeled with `ft` (fine-tuned)
* Look for a model that was **deployed between July 8–10**, and note:

  * Deployment name
  * Creation timestamp
  * If it’s still active

---

### 💣 2. **Delete or Pause the Deployment**

* If the model is still active:

  * Click **“Delete”** to stop further hourly hosting charges.
* If you're unsure whether it's in use:

  * Scale down or disable temporarily and set up an alert (see below).

---

### 🧾 3. **Check Azure Cost Analysis**

* Go to **Cost Management + Billing** > **Cost Analysis**
* Filter by:

  * **Service Name:** Cognitive Services
  * **Resource Type:** `gpt-4.1-ft hosting global Unit`
* Click the row to **see the exact resource name and time of deployment**.

## 🛡️ Preventive Measures

### 🔔 Create a Cost Alert

1. Go to **Cost Management + Billing** > **Budgets**
2. Set a small test budget (e.g. \$20) for:

   * Scope: This specific subscription
   * Filter: `Service Name = Cognitive Services`
3. Set an email alert to notify you when it hits 50% / 75% / 100%

---

### 🧑‍💼 Identify Who Deployed the Model

To find out who deployed it:

* Go to **Monitor** > **Activity Log**
* Filter by:

  * Resource type: `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts`
  * Date: around **July 8–10**
  * Operation: `Create Deployment` or similar

You’ll see which **user account or service principal** triggered the deployment.

## 💬 Want Help?

Would you like:

* A **PowerShell/CLI script** to list and delete fine-tuned deployments?
* A **Log Analytics query** to find deployment events?
* An **email alert template**?

Let me know how hands-on you want to be, and I can tailor a script or walk you through the Azure UI more deeply.
